## AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials Notes

**Amazon EC2** is a virtualized (Virtual Machine) server inside a phisical amazon service that is shared across multiple applications (multi-tenancy). We can compare the EC2 with a Phisical Server from the real World, that you request and create with the capacity you want.
- You configure the OS you want to use (Linux or IOS)
- You decide what do install there: Internal Applications, Web Servers, Databases, etc.
- EC2 Instances are resizable, you can change the capacity/resources of the server when you want. (vertical scaling)
- You control the networking aspect: type of request allowed to your server, public or private access, etc.
